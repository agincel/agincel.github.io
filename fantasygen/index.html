    <h1>Welcome to FantasyGen v1.5</h1>
    <p>FantasyGen is a Fantasy Football Draft Team generator made for FE530 by Adam Gincel, Brian Sullivan, Robert Detweiler, and Pia Om.</p>

    <label>Permutations: </label><input type="number" id="permutations" value="1" style="width: 65px;"/> <br />
    <label>Budget: $</label><input type="number" id="budget" value="47500" style="width: 80px"/> <br /><br /><br />
    <p style="width: 50%; margin: auto; font-weight: bold;">Weights per parameter. These are not currently normalized, so weights will seem nonstandard. If one value is 1, and a second value is 1000, weighting the first value 1000x will make the two equivalent.</p><br/>
