		<h1>Being an RSO Treasurer</h1>
		<p>You've been elected as Treasurer of an RSO at Stevens. Congrats! Now what?</p>
		<p>This site has been developed by a Treasurer of over two years, and it should serve as a guide to answering any question you may have about running the Treasury of an RSO -- how to use your club's P-Card responsibly, how to budget, how to ask for additional funds, how to properly demonstrate how those funds are being spent, and more will all be covered, with helpful guides.</p>
